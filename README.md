# Regime Mamba: Regime Switch Detection in Financial Time Series

## üìù Introduction

Regime Mamba is a novel hybrid deep learning architecture that combines the selective state space model (Mamba) with traditional Jump Models to identify financial market regimes. This project implements the approach described in the paper "Regime Mamba: Regime Switch Detection in Financial Time Series via Mamba‚ÄìJump Hybrid Deep Model."

### Key Features

- **Hybrid Architecture**: Combines Mamba SSM for complex temporal pattern recognition with traditional Jump Models for regime persistence
- **Superior Performance**: Achieves 5.5% annualized return with 11.6% volatility (compared to 5.0% return for state-of-the-art models and 18.9% volatility for buy-and-hold)
- **Enhanced Risk Management**: Demonstrates maximum drawdown of only -31.8% versus -65.2% for buy-and-hold
- **Cross-Market Applicability**: Works effectively across both developed (S&P 500) and emerging markets (KOSPI)
- **Strategy Versatility**: Supports Long/Cash Only and Long/Short trading strategies
- **Global Macro Integration**: Incorporates the Dollar Index as a global macro indicator, improving Sharpe ratios by 98.1% and reducing false signals by 6%

## üß† Theoretical Framework

Regime Mamba bridges the gap between neural architectures and economic regime theory through:

1. **Representation Learning vs. Statistical Clustering**: Mamba leverages deep representation learning for complex non-linear patterns while Jump Models employ statistical clustering with explicit penalty terms

2. **Adaptive Feature Extraction vs. Fixed Feature Analysis**: Mamba dynamically extracts hierarchical features while Jump Models operate on predefined features (Downside Deviation and Sortino Ratio)

3. **Parameter Update Mechanisms**: Mamba's Œît parameters are learned through backpropagation while Jump Models use explicit hyperparameter Œª requiring manual calibration

The architecture allows for effectively capturing regime transitions in financial markets which traditional statistical approaches struggle to identify.

## üß™ Evaluation Methods

### Rolling Window Backtesting
Tests regime identification on consecutive time windows using a pre-trained model.

### Rolling Window with Retraining
Retrains the model periodically based on a rolling window of historical data:
- Uses 40 years of data for each window
- 20 years for training
- 10 years for validation
- 10 years for regime clustering
- Applies identified regimes to the next 5 years

### Smoothing Techniques
Various filtering methods to reduce noise in regime signals:
- Moving Average (MA)
- Exponential Smoothing (EMA)
- Gaussian Filter
- Confirmation Rule
- Minimum Holding Period

## üìà Results

The Regime Mamba model demonstrates superior performance across multiple markets:

| Market  | Strategy      | Ann. Return | Ann. Volatility | Sharpe Ratio | Max Drawdown |
|---------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|--------------|--------------|
| S&P 500 | Regime Mamba  | 5.5%        | 11.6%           | 0.323        | -31.8%       |
| S&P 500 | Buy-and-Hold  | 6.1%        | 18.9%           | 0.287        | -65.2%       |
| S&P 500 | State-of-Art  | 5.0%        | 11.1%           | 0.293        | -25.5%       |
| KOSPI   | Regime Mamba  | 2.5%        | 13.9%           | 0.157        | -45.4%       |
| KOSPI   | Buy-and-Hold  | 3.1%        | 19.8%           | 0.180        | -63.6%       |

The model particularly excels in risk management and volatility reduction, offering a more stable investment approach with significantly improved drawdown protection.

## üöÄ Advanced Features

### Jump Model Integration
Integrate with traditional Jump Models for enhanced regime persistence:

```bash
python rolling_window_train_backtest.py --data_path path/to/data.csv --jump_model True --jump_penalty 32
```

### Dollar Index Ablation
The Dollar Index serves as a critical component, without which:
- Sharpe ratio falls by 49.5% (from 0.323 to 0.163)
- Annualized return drops from 5.5% to 3.4%

### LSTM Variant
Try the LSTM-based model variant instead of Mamba:

```bash
python rolling_window_train_backtest.py --data_path path/to/data.csv --lstm
```
